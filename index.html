            <h2 class="Secheading">Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, or participating in extreme sports. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial, or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.
            <br><br>
            A good adventure story has the ability to draw us into a world we might otherwise never explore. We come to care about the characters and the things that are important to them. We visit places we would normally never choose to go and sometimes glimpse a little spark of adventure inside us we didn't know was there.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">BIKING</h2>
            </div>    
                <p class="text">Biking is the activity of riding a bicycle, which can be done on various terrains such as roads, bike paths, mountain trails, or rough terrain. The term "biking" is sometimes specifically associated with the context of mountain biking, which involves riding a robust bicycle on challenging terrain.
                <br><br>
                Mountain biking typically occurs on trails, dirt roads, or in parks, and it originated as a sport in California, United States. The early participants in the sport utilized cruiser bicycles, characterized by a single-speed design, balloon tires, and an upright seating posture. These bikes had fewer gears, allowing riders to enjoy the experience without the complexity of managing multiple gears. In contemporary mountain biking and off-road cycling, individuals commonly use specialized mountain bikes designed for such environments.

                <h2 class="heading">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport involving the recreational and competitive flying of paragliders. These are lightweight, free-flying glider aircraft launched by foot, distinguished by their absence of a rigid primary structure. The pilot is positioned in a harness or lies supine within a pod suspended beneath a fabric wing. The wing's shape is maintained by suspension lines, the inflow of air through vents at the wing's front, and the aerodynamic forces generated by air passing over its exterior.
                <br><br>
                Bir, a charming and picturesque small town, stands out as an ideal destination for paragliding in India. The locale boasts visual splendor and natural geological formations, including valleys and lush green slopes. Paragliding enthusiasts can choose between a longer flight lasting up to 30 minutes or a shorter journey of approximately 15 minutes, depending on their preferences. The equipment used for paragliding in Himachal Pradesh undergoes rigorous safety testing, and the expeditions are guided by a team of carefully selected professionals. Recognized as one of the premier paragliding spots in Himachal Pradesh, the experience takes place at an altitude of 8000 feet in Bir Billing, offering an unforgettable thrill against the backdrop of breathtaking scenery.

                <h2 class="heading">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                    <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
                Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.</p>
